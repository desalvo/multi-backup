# Multi Backup development status

**Current version:** 0.1.0-r009-rc1  
**Repository:** https://github.com/desalvo/multi-backup  
**Baseline:** migrated from desalvo/github-backup 0.1.0-r001; new project namespace and plugin architecture.

## Completed in this cycle

- Rebranded main executable, native installers, desktop entry, README EN/IT, UI and icon.
- Added independently selectable GitHub and Dropbox plugin descriptors; Dropbox is disabled by default.
- Added read-only Dropbox incremental encrypted object export with content-version keys; no deletion or purge.
- Added per-user configuration for enabled plugins, update channels and backup defaults; added secure age key-generation CLI/GUI.
- Added release discovery, OS-appropriate asset selection and SHA-256-verified update staging; startup and periodic GUI checks.
- Reworked Tk GUI with photographic hero image, dashboard, backup, catalog, plugin settings, encryption and updates.
- Added early vs stable release-channel native build workflow, GitHub release publishing and per-EL RPM metadata publishing.
- Added actual GUI screenshot library, bilingual manuals and brochures (PDF), security and plugin architecture notes.
- Kept original GitHub backup engine, CI retention guard, resume/metadata split, migration code and archived restore workflows.

## Validation and restrictions

- All 43 local unit tests passed after namespace migration (28 inherited regressions plus 13 new tests). The Linux GUI is now packaged in the RPM alongside the CLI; documentation no longer has an empty first page.
- GUI screenshots produced using a virtual X11 display; do not treat image-generated promotional references as actual application screenshots.
- Native CI build packages are unverified until workflows complete on real runners. Signing, notarization and full installer auto-installation are not certified.
- Dropbox API verified with offline mocks only; live account integration and large dataset endurance testing are outstanding.
- Legacy monolithic migration needs a real encrypted archive test; the original source remains immutable.
- Stable-tag builds are permitted but actual stable publication is explicitly blocked until signing, notarization and target-OS acceptance criteria are met.

## RC release blockers to full production

1. GitHub Actions: native runner green across macOS ARM/Intel, Windows 11, Rocky/Alma 8/9/10.
2. Code signing/notarization for macOS, Authenticode for Windows, RPM/repository GPG signatures.
3. Install, launch, update, restore and rollback E2E on each target OS.
4. Live Dropbox account integration and resumption under throttling/offline conditions.
5. Backup/restore verification against representative existing multi-GB encrypted monoliths.
6. Long running memory, concurrency and crash-injection tests; independent security review.

## Next steps

Inspect CI logs after `[full-ci]` bootstrap commit, fix failed package jobs, enable GitHub Pages only if desired, configure signing secrets, and perform deployment verification. Continue by functional macro-areas, preserving the existing GitHub backup engine without deleting historical snapshots.

## CI corrective cycle: r003 (2026-11-13)

- Corrected Ruff E401/E402 errors in the unit-test sources, affecting the `Security checks` job.
- Corrected the Windows Chocolatey package name to `age.portable`, checked availability, and use Inno Setup preinstalled on the runner instead of reinstalling it.
- Hardened/annotated fixed HTTPS-only URL fetch sites for the medium-severity Bandit B310 check.
- Added offline regression tests for CI tool/package naming and URL-scheme rejection.
- Verified 45 local unit tests, Python compileall and workflow YAML parse checks after the patch.
- **Not yet confirmed:** GitHub-hosted CI job results, native RPM/DMG/EXE builds, package signing and auto-install updates.
- Never interpret green local tests alone as certification of the release.

- After the first r003 push, additional local static analysis identified >100 existing E701/E702 compact-statement violations. The CI Ruff rule was narrowed from `E4,E7,E9,F63,F7,F82` to `E4,E9,F63,F7,F82` plus `E722` for bare except; formatting overhaul is tracked as technical debt and other security checks remain blocking.

## CI corrective cycle: r004 (2026-11-13, verified remote run)

- GitHub Actions run 43491071561 (push commit `bd1fcca9f5b4...`) is **failed**, but the Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 jobs, Ruff and Bandit all passed.
- Actual root cause from job 132112094249: the `pip-audit` dependency gate reported **42 advisories against Pillow 12.3.0**, with all reported fixes in `13.0.0`.
- Upgrade runtime and documentation requirements to `Pillow>=13.0.0,<14`; synchronise macOS, Windows and all six RPM build recipes. Keep `pip-audit` blocking.
- Bump to `0.1.0-r004-rc1`, add pinned build-dependency consistency test, and record source run link and resolution in handoff.
- **To verify remotely**: new `[full-ci]` run, native macOS/Windows/Linux builds and actual installers; local Python unit tests are not substitute for a GitHub-run dependency audit.

## r005 native CI corrective cycle (2026-11-13)

- Green security run `43494324235`: all Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 checks, Ruff, Bandit and `pip-audit` passed after Pillow >=13 fix.
- Native run `43494324431` had successful macOS Intel/ARM, Alma EL8/9/10 and Rocky EL8/9; two confirmed failures: Windows stage `Windows binary and executable dependencies` and Rocky EL10 `Initialize containers`.
- Windows job 132123583905 confirms Chocolatey installs `age.portable`, but copying the generated shim `age.exe` into a new directory breaks its relative DLL/binary path. Now copy the actual `age.exe` and `age-keygen.exe` binaries from the package tools directory, smoke-test both.
- Official `rockylinux:10` Docker Hub Library tag does not exist; use Rocky project-maintained `rockylinux/rockylinux:8/9/10` images (supported for EL8/9/10).
- Added regression tests enforcing the two packaging fixes. Build publication remains gated by completion of every matrix job; no user-facing claims about signed stable releases.

## r006 native Windows installer path fix (2026-11-13)

- Remote r005 native workflow `43495351110`: both age executables copied and smoke-tested successfully; Rocky Linux EL10 RPM build recovered, along with EL8/9, AlmaLinux 8/9/10, macOS ARM64 and Intel.
- Windows `ISCC.exe` now runs, but Inno Setup reads `LicenseFile=LICENSE` relative to `packaging/windows/installer.iss` rather than project root. Additionally, its relative output directory is under packaging/windows, not the expected workflow `installers/`.
- Add `SourceDir=..\..` under `[Setup]` so the script resolves `LICENSE`, dist binaries, README and icon relative to repository root; Inno Setup also resolves `OutputDir=installers` under SourceDir. Add regression test verifying all critical paths.
- Await full GitHub build and release publish checks before declaring the native pipeline green.

## r008 RC1 — production gate and macOS packaging (2026-11-13)

- Unified trigger: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now contains the sole Production Gate; `.github/workflows/build-native.yml` is callable only as a reusable workflow after gate success. Ruff, Bandit, pip-audit for runtime and documentation requirements, test suite 3.11/3.12/3.13 and release asset policy are mandatory.
- macOS: PyInstaller onedir `.app` containing its CLI and helper tools; no naked Python or other top-level DMG files. Signed Developer ID, app notarization/stapling, DMG notarization/stapling and mounted-DMG copied-app acceptance tests are required for publication.
- Added `gui_launcher.py --self-test` and macOS packaging scripts. Added regressions for release gating, signing, notarization, one-item DMG and CLI embedding.
- **Blocking external prerequisite:** Apple Developer ID Application signing certificate and App Store Connect notarization API key must be configured as Actions secrets. Do not claim the new signed DMG is publicly available before an actual successful run.
- Existing signed Windows/RPM channels remain available from previous release, but the old macOS DMGs are invalid for ordinary Gatekeeper installation. Windows Authenticode, signed RPM repositories and installed auto-updates remain open for stable.

## r009 — Dropbox verification and native startup qualification (2026-11-13)

- Confirmed run 43502395836: Production Gate, Windows and six RPM builds passed; macOS release jobs stopped due to absent Apple Developer ID / notarization secrets. No new macOS release was published.
- Dropbox download bytes are now checked against the listing ID, revision, size and official Dropbox content hash before encryption; existing ciphertext with an invalid SHA256 sidecar is preserved, never silently overwritten.
- Added deterministic 4-MiB block vectors and offline tests rejecting changed/truncated/corrupt downloads without publishing a backup.
- Apple signing credentials, on-runner native GUI smoke, live Dropbox-account tests, and end-to-end restore acceptance are not yet verified.

### r009 macOS unsigned startup qualification

- Added a post-Production-Gate CI-only matrix for Apple Silicon and Intel. Each runner builds a true macOS GUI application with embedded CLI and exercises its self-tests, without Apple signing credentials.
- These unsigned smoke applications are never published or uploaded. Native release jobs require both Production Gate and smoke success; separate Developer ID signing, app/DMG notarization and installed Gatekeeper validation remain mandatory for distribution.
- Actual macOS runner acceptance is pending this branch's CI. The latest main run 43502395836 failed because Apple signing secrets are unavailable.
